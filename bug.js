This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The issue arises when attempting to access the `uri` property of the selected image object immediately after selecting an image.  Sometimes the `uri` property is `undefined` even if image selection was successful. This is intermittent and does not happen every time.  The problem seems linked to the asynchronous nature of the image picking process and timing issues accessing the results.

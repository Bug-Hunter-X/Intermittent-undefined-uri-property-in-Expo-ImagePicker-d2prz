The solution is to ensure that the code accessing the `uri` property is placed within the `.then` block of the promise returned by `launchImageLibraryAsync`. This guarantees that the `uri` property will be available before being accessed. Here is how to modify the code to ensure proper handling:

```javascript
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

async function pickImage() {
  let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
    mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
    allowsEditing: true,
    aspect: [4, 3],
    quality: 1,
  });

  if (!result.cancelled) {
    // Access uri property HERE inside the .then block
    console.log(result.uri);
    // ... further image processing ...
  }
}
```
By placing the code accessing `result.uri` within the `.then()` block, we ensure that it is executed only after the promise returned by `launchImageLibraryAsync` has resolved, and the `uri` property is properly populated.
